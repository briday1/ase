#TO DO:

## Coding
1. Get MATLAB engine working to develop and test algorithms all in C++
1. Implement a test routine for the SDR functionality (use MATLAB engine for
visualizing and verifying functionality).
1. Implement our SDR barrier method. Use anonymous namespace to implement needed helper functions.
1. Port over C++ functionality for ATSC equalization.
1. Implement a test routine for the ATSC equalization functionality (may need to save off data set from MATLAB).
1. Port over C++ functionality for Reed-Solomon encoding/decoding.
