#TO DO:

## Coding
1. SDP inequality form with general data.
1. Dual SDP inequality form with general data.
1. Generate a test for the log barrier function.
1. Implement SDR barrier method (for real- and complex-valued inputs).
1. Port over C++ functionality for ATSC equalization.
1. Implement a test routine for the ATSC equalization functionality (may need to
save off data set from MATLAB).
1. Port over C++ functionality for Reed-Solomon encoding/decoding.
