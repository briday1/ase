#TO DO:

## Coding
1. Implement max_phase_cut_low_rank_barrier which is our SDR barrier method
implementation.
1. Port over C++ functionality for solving SDR problem.
1. Implement a test routine for the SDR functionality.
1. Port over C++ functionality for ATSC equalization.
1. Implement a test routine for the ATSC equalization functionality.

## Documentation
1. Ensure ported over functionality is appropriately documented (may need to modify Doxyfile.in).
