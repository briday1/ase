#TO DO:

## Coding
1. Implement a test file for the backtracking line search. For the test case use
a simple quadratic for the purely real case with an integer argument specifying
the dimension. Then, a test case for the complex case where the objective
function is the norm squared of a complex vector.
1. Port over C++ functionality for solving SDR problem.
1. Implement a test routine for the SDR functionality.
1. Port over C++ functionality for ATSC equalization.
1. Implement a test routine for the ATSC equalization functionality.

## Documentation
1. Ensure ported over functionality is appropriately documented (may need to modify Doxyfile.in).
